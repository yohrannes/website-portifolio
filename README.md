# Website Portfolio - Yohrannes Santos Bigoli üåê

This project is a practical and robust demonstration of how to build, monitor, and operate a modern application using the best practices in **DevOps**, **web development**, and **cloud infrastructure**. It is designed to be highly scalable, secure, and easy to integrate into production environments.

---

## üöÄ **Overview**

The Website Portfolio combines:
- **Backend in Flask**: A lightweight and efficient Python framework.
- **Monitoring and Observability**: With **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **cAdvisor**.
- **Infrastructure Automation**: Using **Terraform** and **GitLab CI/CD**.
- **Advanced Security**: Configured **Fail2Ban** to protect against malicious attacks.

This project is ideal for professionals who want to learn or implement modern development and operational solutions.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**

### **Backend**
- **Flask**: Python framework for web development.
- **Gunicorn**: WSGI server for production.

### **Frontend**
- HTML, CSS (with custom animations), and JavaScript.

### **DevOps and Infrastructure**
- **Docker**: Containers for all services.
- **Docker Compose**: Local orchestration.
- **Kubernetes**: Deployments in managed clusters.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure automation.
- **GitLab CI/CD**: Pipelines for automated builds, tests, and deployments.

### **Monitoring**
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection.
- **Grafana**: Interactive dashboards.
- **cAdvisor**: Container monitoring.

### **Security**
- **Fail2Ban**: Protection against brute force and malicious injection attacks.
